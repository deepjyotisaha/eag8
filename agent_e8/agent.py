# Find the current point standings of F1 Racers from the internet, and update the results into a spreadsheet in Google Drive, and then share the link to this spreadsheet with me on deepjyoti.saha@gmail.com. While wriiing the result into the spreadsheet, first check if a spreadsheet already exists in Google Drive, with a similar name, if yes, then update the results in the existing spreadsheet with the new results, make sure to update the exact cells; else if no spreadsheet exists, then create a new spreadsheet and update the results; Your email should be well formatted in HTML format.

#- âœ… When searching rely on first reponse from tools, as that is the best response probably. However, ALWAYS check if the response is already available in memory via a previous tool call with same parameters, as that is the most efficient use of time and resources.
